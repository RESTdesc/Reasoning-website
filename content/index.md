# Everyone should get easy access to reasoning
[Reasoning](http://n3.restdesc.org/) is the powerful mechanism to draw conclusions from facts.
The [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) contains vast amounts of data,
which makes it an interesting source to use with one of the several available [reasoners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_reasoner).

However, reasoners can feel complicated,
making them hard for frequent use.
Therefore, this initiative aims to provide a <strong>user-friendly reasoning experience</strong> in current Web browsers and applications.

For a live demo, check out an [online reasoning example](http://n3.restdesc.org/rules/generalized-rules/).
